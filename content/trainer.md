# trainer als vermittler

und nicht als besserwisser.

cf. my workshop @ kanti oerlikon.

teaching how to use scribus, through exercises to teacher that have a graphics background.

i'm a programmer that does a little programming, lot of support and bit of introduction for new programmers to scribus.

the trained are experts, too. in their task. I'm teachign them how to use something new in their task.

pushing something that i know it's not perfect. and in my case, also something that won't match the listener's expectations.
