# trainer als vermittler

und nicht als besserwisser.

cf. my workshop @ kanti oerlikon.

teaching how to use scribus, through exercises to teacher that have a graphics background.

i'm a programmer that does a little programming, lot of support and bit of introduction for new programmers to scribus.

the trained are experts, too. in their task. I'm teachign them how to use something new in their task.

pushing something that i know it's not perfect. and in my case, also something that won't match the listener's expectations.


# slides from the graphics points of view

graphics is not (just) about shiny pictures and fancy typography.

- never distribute your slide.
- never read the content of your slides.
  - slides are there for mood and orientation
- better: very few or very many slides
- don't ask if it's big enough: you can't really change it and people should not spend their time reading your slides.
- no bullets (keywords + spatial placement)
- prepare handouts and distribute them before the presentation (possibly not all at once)
  - part of your audience will try to caputre on paper as much as possible of your words instead of listening to what you have to say.
  - that's not the way the adult learning theory says adults wants to learn, nichtwahr?
- avoid showing wrong things, only the good ones (what people see stays in the mind: right or wrong)
- break up the presentation with changes in the way it runs (but avoid cheap changes)
